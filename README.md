# DNN_Speech_Recognizer


## Tasks
The tasks for this project are outlined in the vui_notebook.ipynb in three steps. 

# Step 1 - Feature Extraction
Extracting features from raw audio files

# Step 2 - Acoustic Model
Implementing different acoustic models to build a speech recognizer from the spectogram data.

# Step 3 - Decoder
Generate perdictions from the final trained model in the previous step.
